\section{Graph Condensations}

\begin{definition}
  A \keyword{condensation} is a function \(f: G \to H\),
  where \(G\) and \(H\) are oriented graphs,
  and \(f\) maps \(V(G)\) to \(V(H)\) surjectively,
  such that
  \begin{itemize}
    \item for any two vertices \(a, b \in V(G)\),
      if \(f(a) \to f(b)\) in \(H\)
      then \(a \to b\) in \(G\).
    \item for any two vertices \(a, b \in V(G)\),
      if \(f(a)\) ties \(f(b)\) in \(H\)
      then \(a\) ties \(b\) in \(G\).
  \end{itemize}
  We call \(G\) the \keyword{uncondensed graph},
  and \(H\) the \keyword{condensed graph}.
\end{definition}

Two examples of condensations are identity condensation
and trivial condensation.

Identity condensation \(i\) maps an oriented graph \(G\) to itself,
such that \(i\) maps every vertex to itself,
and \(f(a) \to f(b)\) if \(a \to b\)
and \(f(a)\) ties \(f(b)\) if \(a\) ties \(b\).
The identity condensation preserves all the edges
and ties, and did not add any ties.
We can see that this map is a condensation by definition.

Another example is trivial condensation \(t\),
which maps any oriented graph \(G\) into a single point.
Because for any two vertices \(a, b \in G\),
\(t(a) = t(b)\), therefore by definition,
\(t(a)\) does not tie or beat \(t(b)\).
Therefore, this mapping also satisfy the definition of condensation.

\begin{definition}
  Given oriented graph \(G\) as the uncondensed graph of
  condensation \(f\),
  A \keyword{component} of vertex \(a \in V(G)\)
  is the pre-image of \(f(a)\),
  in other words, the component of \(a\) is
  \(\set{x \in V(G) \mid f(x) = f(a)}\).
\end{definition}

A component of vertex \(a\) is a set of vertices
that are condensed into the same vertex as \(a\).
For example, the component of vertex \(a\) in oriented graph \(G\)
identity condensation is a set that only contains \(a\) itself,
and the component of a vertex \(a\) in oriented graph \(G\)
is set of all the vertices,
because every vertex in \(G\) are all mapped onto a single vertex,
therefore all the vertices in \(G\) are
condensed into the same vertex as \(a\).

\end{figure}

In \cref{fig: condensation example},
we show a general example of condensation.
In this example,
the distinct components in \(G\) are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) and \(D\),
and they are condensed into vertices
\(A'\), \(B'\), \(C'\) and \(D'\) respectively.
The component of \(a\) is \(A\),
the component of \(d\) is \(B\),
and the component of \(c\) is also \(B\),
because both \(c\) and \(d\) are mapped into vertex
\(B'\) in oriented graph \(G\).

We proof couple theorem to help the understanding of
condensation and components:

\begin{theorem}\label{the: condensation component partition}
  Given any oriented graph \(G\) and condensation \(f\),
  distinct components in \(G\) partitions \(V(G)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Prove distinct components disjoint:
  take any two vertices \(a, b \in V(G)\),
  find component of \(a\): \(A\),
  and component of \(b\): \(B\).
  Assume there exists \(v \in A\) and \(v \in B\).
  Therefore \(f(v) = f(a)\), and \(f(v) = f(b)\),
  therefore \(f(b) = f(a)\),
  and \(B
  = \set{x \in V(G) \mid f(x) = f(b)}
  = \set{x \in V(G) \mid f(x) = f(a)}
  = A\).
  Therefore, \(A\) and \(B\) are not distinct.
  Contradiction.

  Prove every vertex are in a component:
  for every vertex \(v \in V(G)\),
  \(v\) is in the component of \(v\) by definition.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{the: vertex force image beating}
  Given any oriented graph \(G\) and condensation \(f\),
  for any two distinct components \(A\) and \(B\),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      for all \(a \in A, b \in B\), if \(a\) ties \(b\),
      then \(f(a)\) ties \(f(b)\).
    \item
      for all \(a \in A, b \in B\), if \(a \to b\),
      then \(f(a) \to f(b)\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Because \(A\) and \(B\) are distinct components,
  then by \cref{the: condensation component partition},
  \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint,
  therefore for any vertex \(a \in A\),
  and any vertex \(b \in B\), \(f(a) \neq f(b)\).

  Given vertex \(a \in A\) ties vertex \(b \in B\).
  Then \(f(a)\) cannot beat \(f(b)\),
  otherwise \(a\) should beat \(b\), by definition of condensation.
  Also, \(f(b)\) cannot beat \(f(a)\),
  otherwise \(b\) should beat \(a\),
  therefore \(f(a)\) ties \(f(b)\).

  Given vertex \(a \in A\) beats vertex \(b \in B\).
  Then \(f(a)\) cannot tie \(f(b)\),
  otherwise \(a\) should tie \(b\)
  Also \(f(b)\) cannot beat \(f(a)\),
  otherwise \(b\) should beat \(a\).
  Therefore \(f(a) \to f(b)\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{the: vertex force beating relation in condensation}
  Given any oriented graph \(G\) and condensation \(f\),
  for any two distinct components \(A\) and \(B\),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      if any vertex \(a \in A\) ties any vertex \(b \in B\),
      then \(A\) ties \(B\).
    \item
      if any vertex \(a \in A\) beats any vertex \(b \in B\),
      then \(A \to B\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Because \(A\) and \(B\) are distinct components,
  then by \cref{the: condensation component partition},
  \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint,
  therefore for any vertex \(a \in A\),
  and any vertex \(b \in B\), \(f(a) \neq f(b)\).

  Given vertex \(a \in A\) ties vertex \(b \in B\),
  by \cref{the: vertex force image beating},
  \(f(a)\) ties \(f(b)\).
  Thus, for every vertex \(a' \in A\),
  and every vertex \(b' \in B\),
  because \(f(a') = f(a)\) and \(f(b') = f(b)\),
  and \(f(a)\) ties \(f(b)\), therefore \(f(a')\) ties \(f(b')\),
  then \(a'\) ties \(b'\).
  Therefore, \(A\) ties \(B\).

  Given vertex \(a \in A\) beats vertex \(b \in B\).
  by \cref{the: vertex force image beating},
  \(f(a) \to f(b)\).
  Thus for every vertex \(a' \in A\),
  and every vertex \(b' \in B\),
  because \(f(a') = f(a)\) and \(f(b') = f(b)\),
  and \(f(a) \to f(b)\), therefore \(f(a') \to f(b')\),
  then \(a' \to b'\).
  Therefore, \(A\) ties \(B\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{the: components are vertex in condensation}
  Given any oriented graph \(G\) and condensation \(f\),
  for any two distinct components \(A\) and \(B\),
  either \(A \to B\), or \(B \to A\), or \(A\) ties \(B\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Because components are not empty
  (component of \(v\) always contains \(v\) itself),
  we can take \(a \in A\), and \(b \in B\).
  Because \(G\) is an oriented graph,
  then either \(a \to b\), \(b \to a\), or \(a\) ties \(b\).

  According to \cref{the: vertex force beating relation in condensation},
  if \(a \to b\), then \(A \to B\);
  if \(b \to a\), then \(B \to A\);
  if \(a\) ties \(b\), then \(A\) ties \(B\).
\end{proof}

We first see \cref{fig: behaves like a vertex example},
we show an example of a set of vertices \(\set{b, c, d}\)
behaves like the vertex \(v\).
We then try to visualize \cref{the: components are vertex in condensation},
with the help of \cref{fig: condensation example},
we find out that graph condensation just takes the idea
in \cref{fig: behaves like a vertex example}
to the next level: all the components behaves likes a vertex.
A condensation is just to find out those sets of vertices
that behave like a single vertex (components),
and then condense them into a single vertex.

  \label{fig: behaves like a vertex example}  % chktex 24
\end{figure}

Notice although we can define identity condensation
and trivial condensation on all the oriented graphs,
not all the oriented graphs have other condensations
defined on them.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \tikz\graph[simple necklace layout, math nodes, node sep=1.75cm] {
      a -> b -> c -> a;
  };
  \caption{an oriented graph with only
    identity condensation and trivial condensation}
  \label{fig: no condensation example} % chktex 24
\end{figure}

For example, graph in \cref{fig: no condensation example}
cannot have any condensation defined on them
except for identity condensation and trivial condensation,
because we cannot find any components that is not the whole
graph or a single vertex.
For example, if we find a set \(\set{a, c}\),
vertex \(b\) both beats a vertex in the set (\(b\) beats \(a\)),
and are beaten by a vertex in the set (\(c\) is beaten by\(b\)).
Therefore the set \(\set{a, c}\) is not a component.

Condensation is a relatively strong transformation,
because it preserves many properties of the graph.
We will only prove some theorems that will be useful
in later sections.

\begin{lemma}\label{the: shortest path different components lemma}
  Given a condensation \(f: G \to H\),
  for all \(a_0, a_n \in V(G)\),
  such that \(a_0\) and \(a_n\) are in two distinct components,
  and the shortest path from \(a_0\) to \(a_n\)
  is \(P: a_0 \to a_1 \to \cdots \to a_{n-1} \to a_n\).
  Then vertices \(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, a_n\)
  are all in different components.
\end{lemma}

        a_{p-1} -> a_q;

  \caption{the path took a ``detour'' at \(a_p\).}
  \label{fig: same component the not the shortest path}  % chktex 24
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
  Take the first \(a_p\) such that
  there exists \(a_q\) are in the same component \(C\) as \(a_p\)
  where \(p < q \leq n\).

  We then show that \(a_{p-1} \in C\):
  assume \(a_{p-1} \notin C\), then because \(a_{p-1} \to a_p\)
  and \cref{the: vertex force beating relation in condensation},
  \(a_{p-1} \to C\).
  Thus \(a_{p-1} \to a_q\), and path
  \(a_0 \to a_1 \to \cdots
  \to a_{p-2} \to a_{p-1} \to a_q \to a_{q+1} \to \cdots
  \to a_{n-1} \to a_n\) exists and shorter than \(P\).
  See \cref{fig: same component the not the shortest path}.
  Contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{the: condensation preserves shortest path}
  Given a condensation \(f: G \to H\),
  for any \(a_0, a_n \in V(G)\),
  such that \(a_0\) and \(a_n\) are in two distinct components.
  The shortest path from \(a_0\) to \(a_n\) is
  \(a_0 \to a_1 \to \cdots \to a_{n-1} \to a_n\) in \(G\)
  if and only if the shortest path from \(f(a_0)\) to \(f(a_n)\) is
  \(f(a_0) \to f(a_1) \to \cdots \to f(a_{n-1}) \to f(a_n)\)
  in \(H\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Prove \(\Rightarrow \):
  assume \(P: f(a_0) \to f(a_1) \to \cdots \to f(a_{n-1}) \to f(a_n)\)
  is not the shortest path,
  then there exists another path \(P'\)
  from \(f(a_0)\) to \(f(a_n)\): \(f(a_0)
    \to f(b_1) \to f(b_2) \to \cdots \to f(b_{m-1}) \to f(b_m)
    \to f(a_n)\).
  Because \(a_0\) and \(a_n\) are in distinct components,
  then the path \(P'\) does not have length 0.
  If \(P'\) is shorter than \(P\), the path
  \(a_0 \to b_1 \to b_2 \to \cdots \to b_{m-1} \to b_m \to a_n\)
  exists (by definition of condensation) and will be shorter than
  \(a_0 \to a_1 \to \cdots \to a_{n-1} \to a_n\).
  Since \(a_0 \to a_1 \to \cdots \to a_{n-1} \to a_n\)
  is the shortest path from \(a_0\) to \(a_n\),
  contradiction.

  Prove \(\Leftarrow \):
  assume the shortest path is
  \(a_0 \to b_1 \to b_2 \to \cdots \to b_m \to a_n\).
  Because of \cref{the: shortest path different components lemma},
  \(\set{a_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m, a_n}\)
  are all in different components.
  Then by \cref{the: vertex force image beating},
  \(f(a_0) \to f(b_1) \to f(b_2) \to \cdots \to f(b_m) \to f(a_n)\)
  exists and will be shorter than
  \(f(a_0) \to f(a_1) \to \cdots \to f(a_{n-1}) \to f(a_n)\).
  Because \(f(a_0) \to f(a_1) \to \cdots \to f(a_{n-1}) \to f(a_n)\)
  is the shortest path, contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{the: condensation preserves beating in distinct components}
  Given a condensation \(f: G \to H\),
  for all \(a_0, a_n \in G\),
  such that \(a_0\) and \(a_n\) are in two distinct components,
  \(a_0\) beats \(a_n\) by \(n\) steps in \(G\) if and only if
  \(f(a_0)\) beats \(f(a_n)\) by \(n\) steps in \(H\)
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Result of \cref{the: condensation preserves shortest path}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{the: condensation preserves king}
  Given a condensation \(f: G \to H\),
  vertex \(k\) is a king in \(G\) if and only if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(k\) is a king in the
      induced subgraph of the component of \(k\).
    \item \(f(k)\) is a king in \(H\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Denote component of \(k\) as \(C\).
  Denote the induced subgraph of \(C\) as \(G_c\).

  Prove \(\Rightarrow \):
  If \(k\) is a king, then it beats every vertex in \(V(G)\)
  by 1 or 2 steps.
  First, if \(k\) beats every vertex outside of \(C\) by
  1 or 2 steps,
  because of \cref{the: condensation preserves beating in distinct components},
  then \(f(k)\) beats every vertex in \(H\) in 1 or 2 steps,
  therefore \(f(k)\) is a king in \(H\).
  Then if \(k\) beats every vertex \(v \in C\)
  in 1 or 2 steps in \(G\), we split into 2 cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item if \(k\) beats \(v\) by 1 step, then
      \(k\) beats \(v\) by 1 step in \(G_c\).
    \item if \(k\) beats \(v\) by 2 steps, then
      there exists \(a\) such that \(k \to a \to v\).
      \(a \in C\), because of
      \cref{the: vertex force beating relation in condensation}.
      Therefore, \(k\) beats \(v\) by 2 steps in \(G_c\).
  \end{itemize}
  Then \(k\) is a king in \(G_c\),
  and \(f(k)\) is a king in \(H\).

  Prove \(\Leftarrow \):
  If \(f(k)\) is a king in \(H\),
  then \(f(k)\) beats every other vertex \(f(v)\) in \(H\),
  then \(k\) beats every other vertex that is not in \(C\)
  by 1 or 2 steps, by \cref{the: condensation preserves beating in distinct components}.
  If \(k\) is a king in \(G_c\),
  then \(k\) beats every vertex in \(C\) by 1 or 2 steps.
  Therefore, \(k\) beats every vertex in \(V(G)\) by 1 or 2 steps,
  then \(k\) is a king in \(G\).
\end{proof}

Although condensation is a very strong transformation,
some information in the graph does get lost via this transformation.
For example, the beating relationships between all the vertices
in the same components are lost.

  \caption{information lost during condensation.}
  \label{fig: condensation lost information}  % chktex 24
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig: condensation lost information},
we show an example of condensation,
where the vertices \(a_1, a_2\) are condensed into \(a\),
\(b_1, b_2\) are condensed into \(b\),
\(c_1\) is condensed into \(c\),
and \(d_1\) is condensed into \(d\).
If we just look at the condensed graph,
we noticed that we cannot recreate the beating relationship
of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\),
therefore the information about the beating relationship
is lost.
This fact is true for all the vertices in the same component.
Another example in this graph is that
we cannot know the beating relationship between \(b_1\) and \(b_2\)
just by the uncondensed graph.

Notice the beating relationship between components
are not lost.
For example, if we want to know the beating relationship
between \(b_1\) and \(a_2\),
we first observed that \(a \to b\) in the condensed graph,
then by definition of a condensation,
\(a_2\) have to beat \(b_1\) in the uncondensed graph.
Another example is that we can know that \(a_1\) ties \(d_1\)
because \(a\) ties \(d\) in the condensed graph.

Therefore, a ``efficient condensation'' should keep as many
vertices as possible.
One of the most ``efficient'' condensation is the
identity condensation, because it does not lose any information
about this graph.
However, identity condensation also do not mutate the graph
at all, therefore it is not very practical.

\begin{definition}
  Given a set of condensation \(F = \set{f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_n}\)
  where \(f_k: G_k \to H_k\)
  and all the \(V(G_k)\) are of the same size for \(0 \leq k \leq n\),
  an \keyword{efficient condensation} \(f: G \to H\) in \(F\)
  is a condensation such that
  \(H\) has largest vertex set in
  \(\set{H_0, H_1, H_2, \ldots H_n}\)
\end{definition}

Notice in this definition,
all the \(G_k\)'s where \(0 \leq k \leq n\) are not
necessarily distinct.
One example of efficient condensation is
given a graph \(G\) and all the condensation defined on \(G\),
that is  \(\set{f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_n}\) where \(f_k: G \to H_k\).
Then the identity condensation,
is an efficient condensation in this set,
since it keeps all the vertices.
