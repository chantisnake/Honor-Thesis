\chapter{Further Problems}

In \cref{chap: semi-complete digraph} and \cref{chap: general oriented graph},
we see that because of the addition of two types of ties,
we can construct many more \((n, k)\) semi-complete digraphs
or \((n, k)\) oriented graphs than \((n, k)\) tournaments.
Then what can we construct if we limit the number of ties
or double ties?

\begin{definition}
  a \((n, k, t)\) digraph is a digraph with \(n\) vertices,
  \(k\) kings and \(t\) ties (or double ties).
\end{definition}

In \cref{chap: semi-complete digraph}, and \cref{chap: general oriented graph},
we explore the construction of \((n, k)\) semi-complete digraphs
and \((n, k)\) oriented graphs with 1 tie.
In other word, we have solved the problem of constructing
\((n, k, 1)\) oriented graph and semi-complete digraphs.
What happens with \(t\) gets larger?

In \cref{sec:kings}, we showed that there exists king with very
low out-degrees.
What is the property of a king with very low out-degree?
What is the property of a king with only out-degree 1?
what is the property of a king that has the lowest out-degree
in the graph?
What is the property of a king that has the lowest out-degrees
among all of the kings in the graph?

In \cref{sec: quasi-transitive king},
we have showed that king has very rich structures.
However, \cref{the: king partitions in quasi-transitive}
and \cref{the: D S of king adjacent in quasi-transitive}
are not used in this thesis.
Can we use these 2 property to deduce any property
of quasi-transitive oriented graph with kings?
A interesting path is that
\cref{the: D S of king adjacent in quasi-transitive}
implies in a quasi-transitive oriented graph with king \(k\),
all the tie components are either the subset of \(D_k\) or \(S_k\).

\begin{definition}
  A infinite graph is a graph with infinite number of vertices.
\end{definition}

Can we extend these result to infinite graph?
Can we keep the definition of tie components when
we expand the context to infinite graph?

In \cref{sec: graph condensation},
we showed that graph condensation is a very strong transformation
and many graph only have identity condensation
and trivial condensation defined on it.
How hard is a condensation?
How many graph only have identity condensation
and trivial condensation on them?

In~\cite{bang-jensen_kings_1998}
and~\cite{bangjensen_quasitransitive_1995},
the author uses the idea of strong digraph and strong components
to deduce the property of quasi-transitive oriented graph.
We can show that quasi-transitive oriented graph is strong
if and only if its underlying tournament is strong
(\cref{the: shortest path different components lemma} will be useful).
Can we combine our results with the result
in~\cite{bang-jensen_kings_1998} and~\cite{bangjensen_quasitransitive_1995}?
