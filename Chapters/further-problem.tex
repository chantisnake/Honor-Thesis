The existence of a \((n, k, t)\) digraph.
\begin{definition}
  a \((n, k, t)\) digraph is a digraph with \(n\) chickens, \(k\) kings and \(t\) ties.
\end{definition}


What is the property of a king with very low out-degree?

Can we extend these result to infinite graph?

How hard is a condensation?
How many graph only have identity condensation
and trivial condensation on them?
