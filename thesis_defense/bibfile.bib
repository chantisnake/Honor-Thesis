These are defined to be those digraphs for which the following holds: for every vertex x the vertices dominated by x induce a semicomplete digraph and the vertices that dominate x induce a semicomplete digraph. (A digraph is semicomplete if for any two distinct vertices u and ν, there is at least one arc between them.) This class contains the class of semicomplete digraphs, but is much more general. In fact, the class of underlying graphs of the locally semi-complete digraphs is precisely the class of proper circular-arc graphs (see [13], Theorem 3). We show that many of the classic theorems for tournaments have natural analogues for locally semicomplete digraphs. For example, every locally semicomplete digraph has a directed Hamiltonian path and every strong locally semicomplete digraph has a Hamiltonian cycle. We also consider connectivity properties, domination orientability, and algorithmic aspects of locally semicomplete digraphs. Some of the results on connectivity are new, even when restricted to semicomplete digraphs.},

Clearly, a 2-quasi-transitive digraph is a quasi-transitive digraph in the usual sense. Bang-Jensen and Gutin proved that a quasi-transitive digraph D has a 3-king if and only if D has a unique initial strong component, and if D has a 3-king and the unique initial strong component of D has at least three vertices, then D has at least three 3-kings. In this paper we prove the following generalization: a k-quasi-transitive digraph D has a (k+1)-king if and only if D has a unique initial strong component, and if D has a (k+1)-king, then either all the vertices of the unique initial strong components are (k+1)-kings or the number of (k+1)-kings in D is at least (k+2).

Solving a conjecture by Bang-Jensen and Huang (1995), Gutin (1995) described polynomial algorithms for finding a Hamiltonian cycle and a Hamiltonian path (if it exists) in a {QTD}. The approach taken in that paper cannot be used to find a longest path or cycle in polynomial time. We present a principally new approach that leads to polynomial algorithms for finding vertex heaviest paths and cycles in {QTDs} with non-negative weights on the vertices. This, in particular, provides an answer to a question by N. Alon on longest paths and cycles in {QTDs}.},

Our proof implies a polynomial algorithm to decide if a digraph is round. 1 The theorem We assume that a digraph has no loops or multiple arcs but may contain a cycle of length 2. If it contains no cycle of length 2, then it is an oriented graph. Let D be a digraph. We say that a vertex x is adjacent to a vertex y in D if there is at least one arc between x and y. If xy is an arc of D, then we say that x dominates y and use the notation x-t y to denote this. If x-t y, then y is an out-neighbour of x and x is an in-neighbour of y.

It was observed there that every vertex-transitive digraph of orderpkormp, wherepis a prime,k≥1 andm≤pare positive integers, has a semiregular automorphism. On the other hand, there are transitive permutation groups without semiregular elements [4].
